# Smart_Traffic_Lights
The plan is to have a connected smart traffic lights grid in a city that could be manipulated based on the situations of emergency. The demonstration is of an ambulance that travels on an optimized path/route with max possible speed to reach the destination in the minimum time possible. The path traffic density will be optimized by controlling the traffic lights to allow the uninterrupted movement of the ambulance.
We are using â€œSimulation of Urban MObility" (SUMO), which is an open-source platform to simulate traffic and control
